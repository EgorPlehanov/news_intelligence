### Detailed Function Description

1. News Collection from Various News Sources
- The application automatically collects news from various sources.
- It utilizes specialized parsers to extract news from each resource.

2. News Grouping by Topic
- After collecting the news, the application analyzes their content and determines which news articles belong to the same topic.
- News articles related to a particular topic are grouped together into a news digest.

3. Generation of Concise News Digests
- The grouped news undergo compression, which identifies the most important information within their texts and keeps only that.
- In the final stage, the compressed texts go through artificial intelligence processing, which transforms the most significant information from the news cluster into coherent and readable text, along with generating a headline for it.


### Recommendations and Tips:

1. Periodically Refresh the News Digest Page
- To receive the latest news, it is recommended to periodically refresh the news digest page.
- Click the "Create Digest" button in your web browser to fetch the latest news based on your selected parameters. This note applies to the digest for the current day. The data in the database is updated every hour.

2. Customize Your News Preferences
- The application provides the option to select news sources and dates to receive more relevant digests.
- Consider choosing your preferred news sources and dates from the left panel on the application screen.

3. Refer to the Original Sources
- When using the application, it is important to understand that the information provided in the news digests undergoes machine processing and topic consolidation. As a result of this process, there may be some confusion or loss of details from the original news articles. Therefore, it is always recommended to refer to the original news sources for comprehensive and accurate information.
- The developed resource aims to provide you with a new experience of interacting with news information by allowing you to receive news digests on various topics in a convenient format. However, it is not possible to guarantee absolute accuracy and completeness of the news digests as they are the result of automated processing.
- Therefore, if you require more detailed or reliable information about a specific news article, it is recommended to consult the original news source, which is provided in each card and can be accessed by clicking the "Show Sources" button. Verifying sources is an important practice that will help you obtain objective and reliable information, form a complete picture of events, and make informed decisions based on trusted sources.
